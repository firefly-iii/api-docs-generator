# API docs generator

## Introduction

The `build-api-docs.php` script in this repository generates the API documentation for Firefly III.

The API specification is generated by stitching together a number of YAML files. The yaml files can be found in [the API docs repository](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs) (in then `src/` directory).

The results are uploaded to the [API documentation](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs) repository (the `dist/` directory) and can be viewed live at [api-docs.firefly-iii.org](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/).

## How to build

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables accordingly, e.g.

 ```dotenv
API_DESTINATION=../api-docs/dist
API_SOURCE_ROOT=../api-docs/src
API_SERVER=https://demo.firefly-iii.org
```

Install PHP `yaml` extension. It should be added to your `php.ini` automatically.

Install dependencies via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

`composer install`

Generate `firefly-iii-develop-v1.yaml` files:

`php build-and-deploy.php`

The resulting `firefly-iii-develop-v1.yaml` file can be imported into your favorite API development environment to play around with, e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).
