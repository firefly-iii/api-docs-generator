# API docs generator

## Introduction

This repository contains the API specification for Firefly III, both "v1" and "v2".

The API specification is generated by stitching together a number of YAML files using a build script, `build-and-deploy.php`.

The results are uploaded to the [API documentation](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs) repository and can be viewed live at [api-docs.firefly-iii.org](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/).

## Contributing

Feel free to create a PR on anything. If you want to change endpoints, check out `/yaml/v*/paths`. Or edit objects in `/yaml/v*/schemas`. This is my first API document so feel free to tell me how to improve. Depending on which API you're interested in, browse to `/yaml/v1` or `/yaml/v2` and find the path or schema you want to edit. Make your changes and submit a pull request.

## Templates

You can see lines in the YAML files that look like this:

```yaml
!notFoundResponse,3
```

These are placeholders which will be changed during build. You see the name of the template (see `/yaml/templates/`), and the number tabs to indent the template.

## How to build

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the variables accordingly, e.g.

 ```dotenv
 API_DESTINATION=./
 API_ROOT=./
 IS_DEVELOP_RUN=true
 ```

Install PHP `yaml` extension. It should be added to your `php.ini` automatically.

Install dependencies via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

`composer install`

Generate `firefly-iii-v*-develop.yaml` files:

`php build-and-deploy.php`

The resulting `firefly-iii-${API_VERSION}.yaml` file can be imported into your favorite API development environment to play around with, e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

## Current state
I'm actively writing all API documentation, so the file may change.

## Why this repository?

The yaml files were getting insanely large and very repetitive, so I cobbled something together. I'm aware there are many API generators out there, that can generate from source, from comments, from whatever. Most however, do not seem to support the complicated objects Firefly III tends to use. I am working on both a simpler API and better documentation, but these tools will probably not fit my use case.
